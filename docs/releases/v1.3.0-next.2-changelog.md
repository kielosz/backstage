# Release v1.3.0-next.2

## @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend@1.3.0-next.2

### Minor Changes

- ce0d8d7eb1: Fixed a bug in `publish:github` action that didn't permit to add users as collaborators.
  This fix required changing the way parameters are passed to the action.
  In order to add a team as collaborator, now you must use the `team` field instead of `username`.
  In order to add a user as collaborator, you must use the `user` field.

  It's still possible to use the field `username` but is deprecated in favor of `team`.

  ```yaml
  - id: publish
    name: Publish
    action: publish:github
    input:
      repoUrl: ...
      collaborators:
        - access: ...
          team: my_team
        - access: ...
          user: my_username
  ```
